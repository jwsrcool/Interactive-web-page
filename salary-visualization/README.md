# JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Salary Calculator

This project is an interactive data visualization based on the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey 2024. It allows users to calculate and compare developer salaries based on country, position, and experience level.

## Features

- Interactive salary calculator
- Visual comparison of salary data
- Insights based on the selected parameters
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Design

The application is based on the design from the [JetBrains IT Salary Calculator](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-it-salary-calculator/).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
